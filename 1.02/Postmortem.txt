What was the purpose of your program?
My program interacts with the user and explains an application of computational thinking.

How could your program be useful in the real world?
It can explain an application of computational thinking.

What is a problem you ran into, and how did you fix it?
I initially used the "input" function, however "input" essentially evaluates the result of "raw_input". I switched to "raw_input" and now my program works.

Describe one thing you would do differently the next time you write a program.
I will make my program more interactive and more feature-packed.

How could your program be generalized and useful in other areas?
My program could be generalized and applied in any area in which an explanation for a topic is required.
